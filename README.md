# Study web app
I decided to build this app to become more comfortable with the C# language as well as utilizing ASP.NET. <br />
This project was built to act as an aid for students looking for a platform to share computer science questions and answers to assist with studying. <br />
This project allows anyone (guests) to enter the site and view computer science related questions and answers created by users who have registered on the site. No guest may create, edit or delete questions unless they create an account or login to an existing account. <br />
This project is not hosted on a webserver but will work locally and stores users logins, questions and answers in a database which is accessed via SQL statements.
