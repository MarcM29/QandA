# Study web app (C#, SQL & ASP.NET, MVC)
I decided to build this app to become more comfortable C# and ASP.NET. as well as utilizing the MVC design pattern<br /> <br />
This project was built to act as an aid for students looking for a platform to share computer science questions and answers to assist with studying. <br /><br />
This project allows anyone (guests) to enter the site and view computer science related questions and answers created by users who have registered on the site. Guest may only VIEW questions and answers, they cannot create, edit or delete questions unless they create an account or login to an existing account. <br /><br />
This project is not hosted on a webserver but works locally and stores users logins, questions and answers in a database which is accessed via SQL statements.
<br /><br />
#Under the demoIMGS directory you will find some images displaying some of the functionality of the app <br />
-Such as displaying the list of practice problems users have created
-Inputting a search query in the search tab
-Result of the search query
-Viewing, editting and deleting practice problems
